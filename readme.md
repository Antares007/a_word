# Actionable Word

In the world of software, we have a persistent problem: the lack of a universal building block that could simplify the process of connecting software systems and expressing problems in a language that resembles human speech. What we need is a definitive term that could revolutionize software development. Thankfully, we've made significant progress in this effort and have created a perfect loop with actionable words and sentences.

The main idea is to make the execution flow straight in time, moving only in one direction like time does. And just as time curves, the execution flow will also curve.

An actionable word is a unit of composition that doesn't require a call stack. Its power lies in its ability to compose the execution flow in a way that is scalable, distributable, and tailored to our needs. In software, any problem can be solved through indirection, where actionable words are composed with each other through indirect connections. An actionable word is also a unit of composition that can resolve memory management problems.

Actionable words make it possible to do things that were impossible to do straightforwardly and simply. Actionable sentences are the way to conquer time-related problems in software.

Like human language, actionable words have a concept of rotation around the word's core. In actionable sentences, execution flows in both directions, and we can control the direction of execution flow.

An actionable word is an essential building block that enables us to program machines without knowing how to code. It has the ability to split programming into two parts: programming by actionable words, which any human can do, and making actionable words, which requires more experienced programmers who know how to code in machine/programming languages.

An actionable word is a new building block, so it's a new concept. To better understand it, we can draw analogies to other building blocks. For example, we can compare it to a cell in botany, which is a unit of composition in the cellular dimension. In a cell, we have other building blocks, such as proteins, which are constructed from simpler building blocks like molecules. Similarly, actionable words are like cells, and C functions/lambda functions are more like molecules and proteins in cells.

With actionable words, we can break down complex AI models into simpler and more reusable building blocks, making it easier to reason about and compose models with higher-level abstractions.

Furthermore, actionable words can help us create more explainable and interpretable AI models. By using simple and understandable building blocks, we can better understand how AI models make decisions, which is crucial for building trust and ensuring fairness in AI systems.

Additionally, as more people use and contribute to actionable words, a library of pre-existing building blocks could emerge, similar to how open-source libraries work today. This library of actionable words could significantly reduce development time and increase the quality of software by enabling developers to leverage pre-existing, well-tested building blocks instead of building everything from scratch.

In summary, actionable words have the potential to not only simplify software development but also make AI more accessible, understandable, and trustworthy.
